def resolve_dependencies(available, unresolved, dependencies, resolve_function):
    '''
    Resolves dependencies.

    Args:
      `available`: a dictionary of already resolved items.
      `unresolved`: a dictionary of items that have not been resolved.
      `dependencies`: the items upon which each unresolved item is dependent.
      `resolve_function`: a function that resolves an item with arguments
           (unresolved_name, unresolved_item, dictionary_of_resolved_items)

    Returns:
      `resolved`: a dictionary of resolved items.
